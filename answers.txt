What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge will create a merge commit and preserve the commit history while a rebase will add changes to an existing branch and keep the commit history linear.
What is a remote repository?

A repository that exists somewhere else from the local respositories of the collaborators, the remote repository will hold the live version.
